Decisional Diffie-Hellman: compute Legendre symbol of g^ab from g^a and g^b?
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/31378/decisional-diffie-hellman-compute-legendre-symbol-of-gab-from-ga-and-g
Because (I assume) g is a generator, it is not a square (prove this), 
so its Legendre symbol is ‚àí1. And hence, the Legendre symbols of 
g^a and g^b leak the parities or ùëéand b. Hence they leak the parity of ab, 
which leaks the Legendre symbol of g^ab.


How does the Legendre symbol reveal if g^a is odd or even for Finite Field Diffie-Hellman
