## Uniform Distribution


## Non-uniform Distribution

The opposite of a uniform distribution is a non-uniform distribution. In a uniform distribution, every outcome in a given range has an equal probability of occurring. In contrast, a non-uniform distribution has probabilities that vary across different outcomes.

Common types of non-uniform distributions include:

Normal Distribution: Characterized by a bell-shaped curve where most values cluster around a central mean, with probabilities tapering off symmetrically towards the extremes.

Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, where these events happen independently and with a known average rate.
